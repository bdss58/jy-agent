"""Tests for the ``LLMClient`` Protocol contract.

Codex review 2026-04-25 (Part 3 finding #5) flagged that the runtime
imported the concrete ``LLMOwner`` class.  Refactor #3-B introduced an
``LLMClient`` Protocol so the engine depends only on the contract; any
object satisfying it can drive ``AgentLoop``.

These tests guard the contract:

  1. The real ``LLMOwner`` satisfies ``LLMClient`` structurally.  This
     is the **non-regression** check — if anyone changes ``LLMOwner``'s
     signature for ``complete()``/``stream()``/``model_spec``, this test
     fails BEFORE the engine breaks at runtime.

  2. A pure-fake client that does NOT import ``LLMOwner`` can drive
     ``AgentLoop`` to completion.  This is the **liveness** check — it
     proves the Protocol is the real coupling boundary, not a polite
     fiction that secretly relies on duck-typed access to LLMOwner
     internals.
